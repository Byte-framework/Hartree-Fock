# Hartree-Fock
Through this code, I have demonstrated an implementation of the self-consistent field method. The test case used here is that of  a water molecule with bond-length of 1.1 Ã… and a bond angle of 104.0 degree   with STO-3G basis set.

My code was based on the programmiing project given in Crawford group github page - https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master/Project%2303.
