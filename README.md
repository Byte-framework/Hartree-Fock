# Hartree-Fock
Through this code, I have demonstrated an implementation of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field (SCF) method. The test case used here is that of  a water molecule with bond-length of 1.1 Ã… and a bond angle of 104.0 degree with STO-3G basis set.

The inputs required for the project are :
[nuclear repulsion energy] (./enuc.dat), [kinetic energy integrals] (./ke.dat), [overlap integrals] (./s.dat), [nuclear attraction integrals) (./pe_v.dat)and [electron-electron repulsion integrals] (./two_integ.dat) . 

My code was based on the programmiing project given in Crawford group github page - https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master/Project%2303.
